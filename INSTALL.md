### [Hyper](https://hyper.is/)

#### Install using config file

If you are a git user, you can install the theme by cloning the repo to `~/.hyper_plugins/local/`:

    $ git clone https://github.com/getomni/hyper.git ./hyper-omni

Otherwise, you can download using the [GitHub .zip](https://github.com/getomni/hyper/archive/master.zip) option and unzip them on your plugins folder.

After that you need to add `hyper-omni` to the `localPlugins` list in your `~/.hyper.js` config file.

    localPlugins: ['hyper-omni']

#### Activating theme

1.  Start Hyper;
2.  Go to `View -> Full Reload`.
